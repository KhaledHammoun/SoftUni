                When i gave birthin early September, I knew it would change my life. What I wasn`t aware of, though, was just how much it would transfom me and my daily life in every single way.

                Tending to my crying baby takes precedence over looking at the mirror. 30-minutes showers have become swift splashes. Make up doesn`t matter nealry as much. My skin care routine is less of a routine and more of a infrequent luxury.
